# 🔒 Secure Data in Python Flask

## 📌 Overview
This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing security best practices in Python Flask applications. It covers various aspects of securing data, including authentication, encryption, and secure communication.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔑 **User Authentication**: Implement secure login/logout using Flask-Login and Flask-Security.
- 🔐 **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data using cryptography libraries.
- 🛡️ **Input Validation**: Prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- 🔍 **Secure API Endpoints**: Protect API routes with authentication and role-based access control.
- 🌍 **HTTPS and SSL/TLS**: Enforce secure connections.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Flask
- 🔑 Flask-Login
- 🔒 Flask-Security
- ✅ Flask-WTF
- 🔏 Cryptography
- 🗄️ SQLAlchemy

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. 📥 Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-flask-app.git
   cd secure-flask-app
   ```
2. 🏗️ Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. 🔧 Set environment variables for security:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   export SECRET_KEY='your-secure-secret-key'
   ```
4. ▶️ Run the application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

## 🔥 Security Best Practices
- 🔑 Use strong, unique passwords and store them securely.
- 🛡️ Always sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection.
- 🔒 Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmission.
- 👥 Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to protect sensitive actions.
- ♻️ Keep dependencies up to date to prevent vulnerabilities.
